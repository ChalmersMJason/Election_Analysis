# Election_Analysis
Module 3 - Python

# Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has requested the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional district. 
* Calculate the total number of votes cast
* Get a complete list of candidates who received votes
* Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
* Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
* Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote
* Determine the county that received the most votes and how many votes that county received

# Resources
* Data source: election_results.csv
* Software: Python 3.6.1, VS Code

# Results

* 369,711 votes were cast in the congressional election
* The below shows the breakout of votes by county, including total votes and percentage of total vote.

* Diana Degette won the election with 73.8% of the vote (272,892 votes)

# Summary
The method of performing this analysis can be repurposed and provide future value for the election commission. 
Two suggestion for how this can be used moving forward:
* After a future election, upload a CSV file with the new dataset & change the name in the line of code below to match the new file's name. The file for this analysis was called, "election_results.csv".

* This analysis can also be combined with future analyses to track voter turnout trends. By comparing the total votes in each county for this election and comparing it to the next, the election commission can see if more or less people are turning out to vote.
